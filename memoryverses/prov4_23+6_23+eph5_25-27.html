			<h1>Prov 4:23 & 6:23 & Eph 5:25-27</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Proverbs 4:23 &rightarrow; Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.</p>
			<p>6:23 &rightarrow; For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>
			<p>Ephesians 5:25-27 &rightarrow; 
				<sup>25 </sup>For Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 
				<sup>26 </sup>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 
				<sup>27 </sup>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
